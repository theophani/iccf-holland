  A child in Uganda needs your help, today.

<p class="secondary-plea">
  Support the <a href="/kcc">Kibaale Children’s Centre</a>, and the children and families it serves. Read the most recent <a href="/visit-report">visit report</a> or learn more about the <a href="/visit-report">International Child Care Fund Holland</a>.

  The south of Uganda has been suffering from the highest HIV infection rate in the world. Parents die of AIDS just when their children need them most. An extended family can be their new home. Fortunately there is enough food in this farming district. But who will pay their school fees, provide medical aid and help them grow up? That is where ICCF Holland helps in the hope that they will be able to take care of themselves, and their children, in the long run.
