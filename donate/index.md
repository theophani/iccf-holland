Each of the four (five?) donation pages will focus on one specific method, with a “other ways to donate” section promoting the other methods.

The main donation page will feature cash donation via paypal, thought will mention other methods, and that back transfer is preferred. The other pages will promote: sponsor a child, give a gift, sponsor a room, referral links to Amazon.

Rather than put all of the tax receipt details on these pages, it makes sense to have a single line that says “We give tax receipts on request. If you would like a tax receipt, please read [the details for your country](tax-receipts) before donating.”
